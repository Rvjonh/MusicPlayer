## MediaPlayer

Media player to listen to some of my favorite songs anywhere, I always wanted to build a media player to know how this type of software work, so I decided to code one with the simpliest tecnologies beside on the web.
So this project uses the next tecnologies:

Tecnologies

-   HTML
-   CSS (SCSS)
-   JAVASCRIPT (Vanilla)
-   Manipulation of Audio API
-   Use of shortcuts through the keyboard key

## Deployment

1. UseLive Server v5.6.1 or above (to see it in your browser)
2. Live Sass Compiler v3.0.0 or above (if you want to change the SCSS files "stylies")
3. Visual studio Code (or a code editor)

:) and that is it, I hope you enjoy my songs.
